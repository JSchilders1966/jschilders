                            <p>
                            My name is Jeff Schilders. I'm a creative and innovative individual with a deep passion for technology and science fiction.
                            Over the years, I've had the opportunity to start two companies and work for several others across various sectors.
                            Currently, I'm engaged in the field of Education, focusing on the integration of digital technology into teaching and learning.

                             My journey into the world of technology began in the 1980s when I purchased my first computer, a Commodore VIC 20.
                             Since then, I've been on a self-taught exploration, accumulating a wealth of experience along the way.
                             From programming to system administration, my background spans a wide range of tech-related disciplines.
